## iHome Intranet App

- A custom intranet single page application built with Angular.js on top of SharePoint 2013
- Built by [http://streamlinedstudio.com](http://streamlinedstudio.com)

## Dependencies
- [Angular.js v1.4.11](https://github.com/angular/angular.js)
- [SharePoint 2013 REST api](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj860569.aspx) to pull the data
- [Twitter Bootstrap v3.3.6](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) as our css framework
- [Moment.js v2.13.0](https://github.com/moment/moment) for date manipulation
- [Font Awesome v4.6.3](http://fontawesome.io) for icons

## Build Tools
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) for a dev environment
- [Bower](https://bower.io/) & [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) as package managers
- [Sass v3.2.9](https://github.com/sass/sass) as a css preprocessor
- [Gulp v3.9.0](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) as a task runner

## Benefits of this approach:
- **Version agnostic**, meaning you can port it to any version of 2010+ version of SharePoint
- **Database agnostic**, you can port it to any database with RESTful API endpoints
- **Feature independent**, No serverside code, meaning this works seamlessly with your other SharePoint infrastructure and does not require any specific sharepoint features
- **Agency independent**, meaning we want to you work with us because you want to, not because you have to.  Our codebase is readable, supportable, and extendable.
