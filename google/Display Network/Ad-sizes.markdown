#Ad Sizes

If you’ve done any display network advertising, you will no-doubt have developed a set (or two) of banner ads for their network.  Google lists the following sizes in their help section for handy reference.  Banners need to be these sizes (or slightly smaller as you will see in a minute) and have a size limitation of 50k.


*	Banner: 468 x 60
*	Square: 250 x 250
*	Small Square: 200 x 200
*	Leaderboard: 728 x 90
*	Medium Rectangle: 300 x 250
*	Large Rectangle: 336 x 280
*	Skyscraper: 120 x 600
*	Wide Skyscraper: 160 x 600

What Google doesn’t tell you is that when these banners are used in their display network, they often include a display URL and “ad choices” logo which can squish your banner.  As such, its recommended to reduce your banner sizes by 11 pixels to accommodate for the extra bar Google ads.  Here are the “real sizes” for developing banner ads:

*	Banner: 468×49
*	Leaderboard: 728×79
*	Square: 250×239
*	Small-Square: 200×189
*	Large Rectangle: 336×269
*	Medium Rectangle: 300×239
*	Skyscraper: 120×578
*	Wide Skyscraper: 160×578
