#cloning

## get an existing repo
	$ git clone git://github.com/StreamlinedStudio/existing-project1.git

That creates a directory named project1, initializes a .git directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new project1 directory, youâ€™ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used. If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than grit, you can specify that as the next command-line option:

	$ git clone git://github.com/StreamlinedStudio/existing-repo.git newfolder
That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called newfolder.


##clone an existing repo into a new folder
	git clone -b new-project git@github.com:User/YourProject.git newProject
	git clone -b <branch name> <remote repo> <new folder>
